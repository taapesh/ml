Reports of giant anacondas date back as far as the discovery of South America, when sightings of anacondas upwards of 50 metres (167 feet) began to circulate amongst colonists, and the topic has been a subject of debate ever since among cryptozoologists and zoologists. Anacondas can grow to sizes of 6 metres (20 ft) and beyond,[1] and 150 kilograms (330 lbs.) in weight.[2] Although some python species can grow longer,[2] the anaconda, particularly the green or common anaconda, is the heaviest and largest in terms of diameter of all snakes, and it is the second-longest extant snake in the world behind the reticulated python.[1][2] The longest reputably-measured and confirmed anacondas are about 7.5 metres (25 feet) long.[3] Lengths of 50â€“60 feet have been reported for this species, but such extremes lack verification. The only real reliable claims that can be found describe measured anacondas ranging from 26 to 39 feet, although these remain unverified.[3]
