Saltasaurus is very small compared to most other members of the Sauropoda, estimated at 12.8 metres (42 ft) in length and 6.87 tonnes (7.57 short tons) in weight.[4] Powell estimated the adult length at six metres. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the maximum length at 8.5 metres, the weight at 2.5 tonnes.[5] The teeth of Saltasaurus were cylindrical, with spatulate points. Saltasaurus had a relatively short neck with shortened neck vertebrae. The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra.[6] Saltasaurus had vertebral lateral fossae, pleurocoels, that resembled shallow depressions.[7] Fossae that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from Malawisaurus, Alamosaurus, Aeolosaurus, and Gondwanatitan.[7] Venenosaurus also had depression-like fossae, but its pleurocoels penetrated deeper into the vertebrae, were divided into two chambers, and extend farther into the vertebral columns.[7] In Saltasaurus, the vertebral bone was generally cancellous and there were larger air chambers present as well. The limbs were short and stubby with especially short hands and feet. Saltasaurus had more robust radii than Venenosaurus.[8] The belly was extremely wide.
