The Yeti (/ˈjɛti/)[3] or Abominable Snowman (Nepali: हिममानव, lit. "mountain man") is an ape-like cryptid taller than an average human that is said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet.[4] The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.

The scientific community generally regards the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of conclusive evidence,[5] but it remains one of the most famous creatures of cryptozoology. In 2014, however, two hair samples taken from remote regions of the Himalayas have been found to show a 100 per cent genetic match to a prehistoric polar-bear-like creature that existed more than 40,000 years ago. An Oxford scientist prepares expedition to find it.[6]
