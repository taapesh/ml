In American folklore, Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a simian-like creature[2] that is said to inhabit forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. The term sasquatch is an Anglicized derivative of the Halkomelem word s√°sq'ets.[3][4][5]

Scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax,[6] rather than a living animal. This conclusion is due to many reasons, including the lack of physical evidence after centuries of investigation despite the large numbers of creatures that would have to exist to maintain a breeding population.[7][8] Occasional new reports of sightings sustain a small group of self-described investigators.[9] Many reports of sightings are attributed to being various animals, particularly black bears.
